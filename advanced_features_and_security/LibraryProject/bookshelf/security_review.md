# Security Review: HTTPS and Secure Redirects

## Implemented Security Measures

### 1. Enforcing HTTPS
- Enabled `SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT = True` to force HTTPS.
- Configured `SECURE_HSTS_SECONDS = 31536000` to enforce HTTPS at the browser level.

### 2. Secure Cookies
- Enabled `SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE = True` and `CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE = True` to prevent data transmission over HTTP.

### 3. Secure HTTP Headers
- Set `X_FRAME_OPTIONS = "DENY"` to prevent clickjacking.
- Enabled `SECURE_BROWSER_XSS_FILTER = True` to mitigate XSS risks.

### 4. Deployment Configuration
- Updated Nginx configuration to redirect HTTP traffic to HTTPS.
- Set up SSL certificates using Letâ€™s Encrypt.

### 5. Next Steps
- Perform security testing using `curl -I https://yourdomain.com`.
- Regularly update SSL certificates to avoid expiration.

## Conclusion
These measures significantly improve the security posture of the application, ensuring encrypted data transmission and preventing common web attacks.
